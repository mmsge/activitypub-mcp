# Derive this build's git identity into ./build-info.json, so the app can serve it
# at /version. Box-wide convention: naustet-server ADR 0022 (contract in
# naustet-server/docs/health-and-version-contract.md).
#
# Runs on the CHECKOUT (make deploy) — the image has no .git, and the box has no
# Node/Python outside containers, so this is pure git + POSIX sh. The Dockerfile
# picks the file up with the optional-copy glob `COPY build-info.jso[n] ./`, which
# is a no-op when it's missing; the app then reports {"source": "unknown"}.
#
# THE POINT: this runs BEFORE the image build, so the SHA is baked into the IMAGE.
# A `git pull` that isn't followed by a rebuild leaves the container serving the
# old sha — which is exactly the drift a checkout-based deploy badge cannot see.
#
# Two details that look cosmetic and are not:
#   - commit_time is the COMMITTER date (%cI), not the author date (%aI) that
#     generate-page-dates.sh uses. Page dates describe content; this describes an
#     image, and after a rebase an author date can be months older than the code.
#   - `dirty` records uncommitted changes at build time. An image built from a
#     dirty tree is not the commit it claims to be.
#
# COPY build-info.json LAST in the Dockerfile: `built_at` changes every deploy, so
# an early COPY busts the layer cache for every step after it (npm ci, pip install).
# Unlike page-dates, a shallow clone is fine here — only HEAD is read.
